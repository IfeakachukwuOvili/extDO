Task Manager Sidebar Extension

What Is This?

A Chrome/Firefox/Whatever extension that adds a task manager sidebar to your browser. Because, apparently, sticky notes and phone alarms just weren't enough. Now you can procrastinate in style, right next to your flight bookings and Wikipedia rabbit holes.

Tech Stack (Because That's What We Do Now)
> JavaScript (vanilla, because frameworks are for people with time)
> HTML/CSS (with a sprinkle of Flexbox and a dash of "why isn't this centering?!")
> Browser APIs (yes, I read the MDN docs, no, I don't remember any of it)

Features (That Actually Work)
> Add/Edit/Delete Tasks (basic, but hey, it works)
> Sidebar Modal Overlay (modal only covers the sidebar, not your whole life)
> Speech Bubble for Long Tasks (click the ellipsis and bask in your verbosity)
> Weekly Progress Bar (feel guilty about your productivity in real time)
> Quick Add with Smart Input (type "Meeting at 3pm tomorrow" and it pretends to understand)
> Filter & Search (because you will forget what you wrote)
> Light/Dark Mode (your eyes will thank you, sometimes)

Pain Points (A.K.A. Why I Need a Nap)
> CSS positioning. Enough said.
> Modals that refuse to stay in their lane.
> Speech bubbles that like to float off into the void.
> Chrome extension manifest files. Why are there so many rules?
> Debugging in three browsers at once (never again).

Pride (Sort Of)
> It actually works. Mostly.
> The modal overlays only the sidebar. This took longer than I care to admit.
> The speech bubble for long tasks is... charmingly functional.
> Weekly progress bar to remind you (and me) that time is passing.

Why?
Because sometimes you just need to build something for yourself, and then document it so you can remember how it works after a good night's sleep.

Enjoy, or don't. I'm not your manager.
